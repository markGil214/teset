## üì± Touch Testing Checklist

### Phase 1: Basic Navigation
- [ ] **Main Menu**: Tap organ cards to navigate
- [ ] **Heart Selection**: Choose the Heart organ
- [ ] **AR Scanner**: Verify camera access works

### Phase 2: UI Button Testing (Critical)
Navigate to **Heart AR Scanner** and test each button:

#### ‚úÖ Label Controls (Top Right) - Phase 3 Features
- [ ] **Show Labels Button**: Should toggle anatomical labels on/off
- [ ] **Language Toggle**: Should switch between English/Filipino
- [ ] **Immediate Response**: No delay or conflicts

### Phase 3: Anatomical Labels Testing
After tapping "Show Labels":

#### ‚úÖ Label Interactions
- [ ] **Label Tap**: Tap any anatomical label (red/blue bubbles)
- [ ] **Quick Description**: Should show description below label
- [ ] **Info Icon (‚ÑπÔ∏è)**: Tap to open detailed modal
- [ ] **Modal Close**: X button should close modal properly

#### ‚úÖ Label Content Verification

- [ ] **Left Atrium**: Shows description and fun facts
- [ ] **Right Atrium**: Educational content displays
- [ ] **Left Ventricle**: Detailed information available
- [ ] **Right Ventricle**: Modal opens with full content
- [ ] **Aorta**: Medical information shows
- [ ] **Pulmonary Artery**: Complete anatomical data

### Phase 4: Gesture Testing
Test that pinch-to-zoom still works:

#### ‚úÖ Pinch-to-Zoom Gestures
- [ ] **Pinch Out**: Zoom in using two fingers on AR area
- [ ] **Pinch In**: Zoom out using two fingers on AR area
- [ ] **No Button Interference**: Gestures don't accidentally trigger buttons
- [ ] **Smooth Operation**: Gestures work smoothly on canvas area

### Phase 5: Advanced Features
Test max zoom and sliced heart:

#### ‚úÖ Sliced Heart Feature
- [ ] **Max Zoom**: Zoom to maximum level (3.0x)
- [ ] **Confirmation Dialog**: Should show "View Sliced Model" prompt
- [ ] **Dialog Buttons**: Both "Cancel" and "View Sliced Model" should be tappable
- [ ] **Sliced Model**: Should load sliced heart model at max zoom

## üêõ What to Look For

### ‚úÖ Expected Behavior:
- **Instant Button Response**: All buttons respond immediately to touch
- **No Double Taps**: Single tap should be sufficient
- **No Conflicts**: Buttons don't interfere with pinch gestures
- **Smooth Gestures**: Pinch-to-zoom works in open AR areas
- **UI Separation**: Clear distinction between UI and gesture areas

### ‚ùå Problems to Report:
- **Delayed Response**: Buttons take time to respond
- **No Response**: Buttons don't work at all
- **Gesture Conflicts**: Buttons accidentally trigger during pinch
- **Modal Issues**: Popups don't open or close properly
- **Navigation Problems**: Back button doesn't work

## üîß Technical Changes Made

The key fix was changing from **document-level touch events** to **canvas-only touch events**:

- **Before**: Touch events on entire document blocked UI
- **After**: Touch events only on AR canvas, UI handles own events
- **Result**: Clean separation between gesture area and button area

## üöÄ Ready for Production

If all tests pass, Phase 3 Anatomical Labeling System is complete and ready for deployment!
