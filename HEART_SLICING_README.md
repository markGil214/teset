# Heart Slicing Animation - Phase 2 Implementation

## Overview
Phase 2 of the AR Heart Visualization System enables the heart 3D model to split into parts showing internal chambers when zoomed in past a certain threshold. This document provides information on how to test and use this functionality.

## Features Implemented
1. **Heart Slicing Animation**
   - Automatic splitting of heart model when zoomed past 1.5x
   - Smooth animation of heart parts to separated positions
   - Automatic reassembly when zooming back out

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Mobile device detection and optimization
   - Resource management for better battery life
   - Orientation change handling

3. **Debug Tools**
   - Performance monitoring
   - Debug mode for testing heart parts
   - Manual slicing/reassembly controls

## Testing Instructions

### Basic Testing
1. Launch the AR application and scan the Hiro marker
2. Select the Heart model
3. Zoom in to 1.5x (using pinch gesture or zoom buttons)
4. Observe the heart splitting into separate chambers
5. Zoom out below 1.5x to see the heart reassemble

### Debug Mode
For development and testing, there are additional controls available:
- "Force Slice Heart" / "Reassemble Heart" button - Manually trigger slicing animation
- "Debug Heart Model" button - Analyze the heart model structure and mapping
- "Show/Hide Performance Stats" button - Display real-time performance metrics

### Testing Different Devices
This feature has been optimized for different devices:
- Desktop browsers: Full animation with detailed rendering
- Mobile devices: Optimized animations and simplified rendering for performance

### Testing Orientation Changes
1. Rotate your device between portrait and landscape while the heart is sliced
2. The heart parts will reposition to optimize for the new screen orientation

## Notes for Developers
- The heart animation is triggered at zoom level 1.5x (configurable in HeartData.ts)
- Labels appear at zoom level 2.0x
- Performance monitoring is enabled in development mode
- Virtual parts are created if specific named parts aren't found in the model

## Troubleshooting
If the heart model doesn't split correctly:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Use the "Debug Heart Model" button to analyze model structure
3. Verify that the model has properly named meshes
4. Check if the browser supports the required WebGL features

## Next Steps (Phase 3)
1. Add educational content for each heart part
2. Implement highlighting of parts on touch/click
3. Add disease visualization
4. Integrate with audio narration system
