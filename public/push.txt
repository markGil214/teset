git commit -m "Fix zoom controls: Add marker detection to prevent automatic zooming

- Add markerDetected state to track when AR marker is found/lost
- Update zoom handlers to only work when marker is detected
- Add marker event listeners (markerFound/markerLost) to PatternMarker
- Reset zoom states when marker is lost (dialogs, sliced model, etc.)
- Add visual feedback showing marker detection status
- Remove unused modelVisible state variable
- Consolidate duplicate scale logic using getBaseScale function
- Prevent touch gestures when marker not detected
- Disable zoom controls in ARControls when marker not detected

This fixes the issue where zoom controls worked even without scanning the marker, causing dialogs to appear automatically."
